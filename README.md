This App allows the user to add, save, update, and delete contacts from their smart device. When the user adds a contact, the contact is saved into a SQL database for future reference. When constructing this application, it followed the MVVM Framework. This app was developed using Microsoft's Xamarin.Forms, and C# language. All solution files are located within the master branch.
